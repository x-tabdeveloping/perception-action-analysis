# Bezier-Trajectory Paper

Analysis and model definition for our Perception and Action exam project.

## Usage

Install dependencies from requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`bezier.py` contains all necessary code for fitting a hierarchical Bezier-Trajectory Model with PyMC and ADVI. Preprocessing steps can be seen in `preprocess.py`.

Beware that the code is project-specific, and cannot fetch from the Firestore database unless it has my Google account credentials.
